# Beginner DBDP Tutorial: Working with Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) Data

This tutorial is available step-by-step HERE. 

In this case study, we will be using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data. We will be performing the first few steps of the Digital Biomarker Discvoery Pipeline: 
1. Pre-process the data
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Feature Engineering (using the DBDP cgmquantify module)

### Level
Beginner. You have limited knowledge of Python/R. This tutorial is a step-by-step guide.

### System Requirements
* Python (3.0.0+) - If you don't yet have Python installed, please follow [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJC6ldI3hWk) on how to download Python through Anaconda

For beginners, I recommend using either JupyterLab or Visual Studio Code to interface with your notebooks.

### Objectives
* Learn how to work with CGM data
* Learn the first 3 steps of the digital biomarker discovery pipeline
* Compute glucose variability metrics on data

### Dataset
We will be using a small example dataset from a single person's week long CGM data. This data has been de-identified and time shifted.

### Recommended DBDP Resources
