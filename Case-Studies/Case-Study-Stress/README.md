# Case Study on Using Wearables to Detect Stress

In this case study, we will be using wearable sensor data to detect stress. This case study was developed by [Brinnae Bent](https://www.runsdata.org) and [Dr. Amy Herring](https://forge.duke.edu/amy-h-herring-scd). 

This case study is part of dbdpED, the educational resource available through the [Digital Biomarker Discovery Pipeline](https://www.dbdp.org).

### Level
Advanced

### Objectives

* Learn how to work with sensor data from wearables
* Learn how to use the DBDP for digital biomarker discovery (including pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning)
* Determine whether sensor data from wearables can be used to predict stress

### Dataset
We will be using the Wearable Stress and Affect Dataset (WESAD). It is available on the UCI Machine Learning data repository ([Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/WESAD+%28Wearable+Stress+and+Affect+Detection%29)). We recommend that you read and cite the data release paper, available [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3242969.3242985).
